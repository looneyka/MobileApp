Create a mobile web page with the following parts:

1. A big heading that contains your name
2. A table listing university names and some photos (so that each row contains a photo and a university name)

All text should be clearly readable in a mobile device.

Clarification: Ideally, the table should have two columns, one for the image and one for the university name. 
It's ok if you would prefer to put them into one column. 
Ideally, the table will have divs with the right CSS. 
It's ok if you would prefer to use table tags this time. 
Ideally, the table should be clearly readable in a mobile device. 
It's ok if you only make it visible on a laptop for now. 
Eventually, you will need to be able to make multi-column tables for mobile using divs, 
and this homework is a chance to learn how to do that. 
But you can turn in your best attempt and get full credit, 
even if you're not ready to do the ideal. 

Turn in a 1-page PDF. 
The PDF should contain a picture of your app (e.g., an emulator screenshot, or a photo of a real device) and a sentence explaining your webpage.
